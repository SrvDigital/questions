          So its been 4.5 years we are together and feels like kal ki baat ho
        </p>

        <p>
          Once again asking you something (asie to answer pta hai but kya pta ab
          itni options jo hai tumhare pass)
        </p>

        <p>
          So my love, Would you like to be with me forever? Would you like to go
          on a date with me? Would you permit to call you as mine? Would you
          tolerate me? Would you adjust me with my mood swings and my nature?
          Would you love like this forever?
        </p>

        <p>
          I love you from the core of my heart. We have Uncountable memories in
          this period. But tab bhi kuch asie hai jo unforgetable hai.
        </p>

        <p>
          A very Happy Birthday my bestest friend, Hope all your wishes come
          true and you have this smile constant on your face
        </p>

        <p class="center">I LOVE YOU</p>

        <p>
          Ache se soch lo phir answer kar dena ab options ko bhi to dekhna hoga
          na
        </p>

        <p>With all my love and admiration,</p>

        <p>Yours love Vanshika</p>
